# Battleship_In_CMD
A version of the classic game "Battleship" that is playable in the command line.

The purpose of this project is to test my coding abilities and learn Python

If you download the program files, you should be able to run it by executing the command "py battleship.py" in your command line.
You may need to change your present directory to the one where battleship.py is stored.

The project as it is is still incomplete.
TODO:
-optimize AI
-allow choice in placement of ships, rather than randomization
-maybe: save/load mechanism
-maybe: local P2P games, so you can play a friend instead of the AI

This is my first project on GitHub, and my first in Python aside from "Hello World."

Suggestions and criticisms (preferably constructive) are welcome.

The AI algorithms are based on this article: https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/
