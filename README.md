# Battleship_In_CMD

A version of the classic game "Battleship" that is playable in the command line.

The purpose of this project is to test my coding abilities and learn Python

If you download the program files, you should be able to run it by executing the command "py battleship.py" in your command line.
You may need to change your present directory to the one where battleship.py is stored.

The project as it is is still incomplete. I am currently working on adding and optimizing some more advanced AI players based on this article: https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/. Once the AI is finished, I intend to add the ability to play this game with a friend over an internet connection.

This is my first project on GitHub, and my first "professional" (ie. not for school) project.

Suggestions and criticisms (preferably constructive) are welcome.

I hope to continue to add functionality continuously throughout the coming weeks. You can check my progress in the Refactor branch. I will be pushing new code to that branch every few days/weeks until I am finished.
