# Battleship_In_CMD

A version of the classic game "Battleship" that is playable in the command line.

The purpose of this project is to test my coding abilities and learn Python.

If you download the program files, you should be able to run it by executing the command "py battleship.py" in your command line.
You may need to change your present directory to the one where battleship.py is stored.

The AI players are based on the ideas in this article: https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/

As it is, this project is likely as complete as it will be. I attempted to optimze the advanced AI with bit shifts, however there was no noticable improvement in performance, so it was not merged into the main branch.
At some point in the future, I intend to make a JavaScript version of the AI that could be used in a web version.

This is my first project on GitHub, and my first "professional" (ie. not for school) project.

Suggestions and criticisms (preferably constructive) are welcome.
